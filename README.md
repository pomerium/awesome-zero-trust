# Awesome Zero trust

Zero trust is a security model and framework originally described by [John Kindervag in 2010](http://www.virtualstarmedia.com/downloads/Forrester_zero_trust_DNA.pdf). Around that time, as a result of the [Operation Aurora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora) breach, Google also began developing BeyondCorp which shared similar ideas. 

## Summary

### Why? 

Zero trust improves on [perimeter](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4397.pdf) [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter_Security)'s shortcomings, namely:

- Insider threat is not properly addressed; 28% of breaches are [by internal actors](http://www.documentwereld.nl/files/2018/Verizon-DBIR_2018-Main_report.pdf). 
- Impenetrable fortress in theory; multiple entry points (like VPNs), lots of firewall rules in practice.
- The perimeter's scope has expanded. Enterprises today support heterogeneous mix of cloud, on-premise, cloud, and multi-cloud environments. 

### Principles

- Do not trust the network. Network location does not impart trust.
- There are always internal and external threats. Act like you are already breached, because your probably are. 
- Every device, user, and application communication should be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted. 
- Policy should be dynamic, and built from multiple sources.

## Resources

### Software

These tools implement some of the concepts of Zero Trust:

- [ZeroTier](https://zerotier.com) - ZeroTier delivers the capabilities of VPNs, SDN, and SD-WAN with a single system. Manage all your connected resources across both local and wide area networks as if the whole world is a single data center.
- [Pomerium](https://www.pomerium.io/) - Pomerium is a context and identity aware access proxy.
- [Pritunl Zero](https://zero.pritunl.com/) - Free and open source BeyondCorp server providing zero trust security for privileged access to ssh and web applications
- [Transcend](https://github.com/cogolabs/transcend) - BeyondCorp-inspired Access Proxy. Secure internal services outside your VPN/perimeter network during a zero-trust transition.
- [kilo](https://github.com/squat/kilo) - Kilo is a multi-cloud network overlay built on WireGuard and designed for Kubernetes (k8s + wg = kg)
- [wg-dynamic](https://github.com/K4YT3X/wireguard-mesh-configurator) - wg-dynamic is a tool designed officially by WireGuard developing team. This new utility will provide a convenient way of configuring networks dynamically, where mesh network being one of the them.
- [WireHub](https://github.com/Gawen/WireHub) - Decentralized, peer-to-peer and secure overlay networks
- [ztncui](https://github.com/key-networks/ztncui) - ztncui is a web user interface for a standalone ZeroTier network controller.
